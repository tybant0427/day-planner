# day-planner
Day planner app HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, moment.js

As a developer in training I was tasked to finish creating a simple, easy to use daytime work scheduler. The project was brought to me with some basic HTML and
CSS properties. I assigned these properties and classes to a proper function that would match the date and time with the schedule and turn the rows 
different colors based on if it was in the past, present, or future. 

I inserted time blocks in the html, using some bootstrap techniques. I also took a turn at implementing moment.js to show the current date on the header of the page
and corresponding time to work with the planner. 

You can save items indivually by the hour or you can insert multiple items and save them all at once using the the save all button at the bottom of the page. 
You can also clear all the data from the planner if you would like by using the clear all button at the bottom of the page. 
If you leave the page, your data will be stored safely in local storage as long as you save your data. When you return to the page, your data will be fetched from 
local storage and displayed back in the planner. 

The planner works for a normal 8 hour 9 - 5 day but one of the steps I would take to better this app in the future is to expand that out to more hours and days.
